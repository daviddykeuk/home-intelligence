There are a lot of things one can automate around the home, but that doesn't mean you need to do it. I want to make sure that the technology that I install isn't intrusive and makes things easier.

Therefore I have created the following rules for my smart home.

* No feature should require constant babysitting, it should just work.
* No feature should make a task harder than it currently is.
* Features should work off of variables which can be easily changed from an interface.
* It should be possible to turn any feature off at any point and then turn it on again if required.
* Features should not cause frustration for others living in the home.
* Features should be subtle and not "in your face" or tacky.
* Where possible, no data should be stored or processed outside of the home*.
* As the home I live in is rented, no feature should require permanent changes to the house**.

*Yep this means no Alexa or equivalent, even though my phone is a permanently connected microphone, I'm just not into having a dedicated one in the house.

**Hopefully we're moving into our own place soon, so this one can go!
