Hi,

My name's David, I'm a software developer.

I live in a small semi-detached house just outside London in the UK. It's a pretty average looking three-bedroom place, but underneath the average appearance I like to use technology to smarten it up.

I've created this blog to talk about this kind of technology. Each idea that I implement is called a feature, some succeed, some fail and most end up being in a state of permanent work in progress. Hopefully you can learn a few things from my experiences.
